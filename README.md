# NoMoreMeetings
A Worker-Placement video game created to simulate a manager's ability to assign tasks. 

# About
This project was created for a Game Theory course at Trent University that asked students to create a game that had a deeper meaning
beyond just being fun. To create this deeper meaning, NoMoreMeetings used the techniques / suggestions learned in a course
I was taking at the same time (called Management Skills), to help future managers learn about new techniques and how complex
management can be. 


# Gameplay
In NoMoreMeetings, players get to act as a manager who is trying to lead a team of 4 workers to complete a series of tasks. The end goal
being to complete all the tasks (through their employees) while attempting to be the best manager possible. This game attempts to allow
employees to see how difficult management really is, and to help illustrate concepts like strength-based management, time-management skills, 
and treating employees fairly. After all tasks are completed, the manager is given a result depending on their ability to be an effective manager. 

# Notes
Currently this game has a fair few issues and is more meant as a theoretical investigation than a real judgment on management. 
The association with how fast a worker can complete a task is based solely on my own opinion on what "strength" is best associated with
any given task. In addition, some of the win-conditions are unclear on purpose, so that players get an opportunity to reflect on
management styles.
